# nerdysoftassignment

Hello, i am Vitalii Moholiuk. This is my assignment project for Nerdysoft! It is packaged in WAR because of Embedded Tomcat Container. 
There are 3 JSP pages: /home, /creation, /room. Technologies used: Spring Framework (Annotation-based), Java, Maven, JSTL, CSS, HTML, Logback, JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas.
It took me nearly 10 hours to complete, i hope everything is fine!
